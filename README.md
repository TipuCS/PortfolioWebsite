# PortfolioWebsite

This is my website I created to showcase my various projects.
I learnt the Python framework Django to host the website.
I then moved the website files (using GitHub) onto a Google Cloud Platform virtual machine.
Through creating the website, I learnt more about HTML and CSS for the structure and styling of the website.
Then I used Document Object Model in JavaScript to animate the website.

This was a fun project and I definitely learnt alot about the Software Development Life Cycle of a website.

The website has a HTTPS certificate, and the domain is https://tipucs.co.uk

Some projects of mine showcased on the website:
Chess (Python)
MineSweeper (Python)
Snake (Python)
Connect 4 (Python)
RaceTheStar (JavaScript)
