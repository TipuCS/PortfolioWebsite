HOW TO RUN THE SERVER: 
1. Go to Google cloud VM instance	
- Google Cloud -> Compute Engine -> VM instances
2. Go to SSH console for "portfoliowebsite"
3. Run the manage.py file:
- Use the command: "cd PortfolioWebsite; cd Website; nohup sudo python3 manage.py runsslserver 0.0.0.0:443 &"
Explanation:
cd: moves into a folder
nohup: Runs the command "sudo python3 manage.py runsslserver 0.0.0.0:443" even when the terminal is closed
sudo: Forces a command to run, regardless of permissions
python3: package used to run everything
manage.py: The main file running the html/css/javascript files
runsslserver: runs the server using "https"
0.0.0.0:443 : the 443 means https (80 would mean http)

HOW TO UPDATE WEBSITE:
1. Change the javascript Image class source
- "this.image.src = "../static/imgs/" + this.imageName;"
- this is to load the images from the correct file
- the .. means go back a file (from index to static)
2. Go to "GitHub Desktop"
3. Go to the "PortfolioWebsite" repository (top left)
4. Click "Commit to main" bottom left
5. Click "Push origin" to make my local files into the official files of the repository
6. Go to Google cloud VM instance
- Google Cloud -> Compute Engine -> VM instances
7. Go to SSH console for "portfoliowebsite"
8. Pull the new files from Github
- type "cd PortfolioWebsite" to go into the directory
- type "git pull" into the SSH console to update the folders


HOW TO RENEW CERTIFICATE:
Got certificate from zeroSSL (website)
1. go to: https://app.zerossl.com/certificate/new
2. Enter the domain "tipucs.co.uk"
3. Pick 90 day certificate
4. After clicking "next" twice, move onto verifying that I own the domain
5. The verification method im using is DNS (CNAME)
- Go to google domains
- Click "manage" on tipucs.co.uk
- Go to DNS
- Manage custom records
- Create new record
- paste the "Name" from zerossl to "Host name" on google domains. KEEP IN MIND, DO NOT INCLUDE THE "tipucs.co.uk" AT THE END OF "Name" BECAUSE ITS AUTOMATICALLY ENTERED
- Change "Type" to CNAME 
- paste the "Point To" from zerossl to "Data" on google domains
- Click save on google domains
- On zeroSSL, click "Next" then "Veryify Domain" This should be 5-10 seconds max. If you get an error, then you probably forgot to remove "tipucs.co.uk" from end of "Name"
- Download the ZIP of the certificate
- Place new certificates into the PortfolioWebsite/Website Folder (can be anywhere but you must find the certificates in the SSH console later)
6. Update the VM instance's folders into my local folders
- Refer to "HOW TO UPDATE WEBSITE" to add new certificates to the files
6. Go to Google cloud VM instance
- Google Cloud -> Compute Engine -> VM instances
7. Open the SSH console for "portfoliowebsite"
8. Move the new certificates from "PortfolioWebsite/Website" to "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/sslserver/certs/"
- go to "PortfolioWebsite/Website" with command: "cd PortfolioWebsite/Website"
- type "dir" to see the folders/files in this folder
- move the certificate.crt to "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/sslserver/certs/" using command: "sudo mv certificate.crt /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/sslserver/certs/"
- move the private.key to "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/sslserver/certs/" using command: "sudo mv private.key /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/sslserver/certs/"
9. Change the name of the certificates
- change "certificate.crt" to "development.crt" using command: "sudo mv certificate.crt development.crt"
- change "private.key" to "development.key" using  command "sudo mv certificate.key development.key"



Extra Info on the certificate:
https://github.com/teddziuba/django-sslserver
Essentially, what I did was make a valid certificate, then moved the certificate to the position of "runsslserver" certificate so that It would be used
to check for validity when running the https server.
